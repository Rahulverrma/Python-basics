It processes the code line by line, converting it into machine language that the computer can understand and execute. This approach allows for immediate execution and testing of code, facilitating an interactive programming experience. Unlike compilers, which translate the entire code before execution, interpreters handle code dynamically, making them suitable for scripting and rapid development.\n"

Mutable objects, like lists, dictionaries, and sets, allow modifications such as adding, removing, or changing elements. In contrast, immutable objects, such as strings, tuples, and numbers, cannot be altered once they're created; any modification results in a new object."
